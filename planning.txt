The purpose of the World Tracker is to make my campaign run effortlessly.  It will provide both computation and random selection of events to allow
the world to evolve in a hands off manner, as well as provide tracking of lore and party supplies.
Major characters will be tracked, as well as their own resources and supplies.  The organizations will also be represented.

I believe we can do this is modules, though I am not yet aware of how to do this.

Module 1- Lorebox
The Lorebox is the referance for any information I could need on the topic.  It will have the ability to scrub all my text files for names, as well as present
organized lists and quick access to data dumps.  Whenever I need something for a session, a few key strokes should deliever it up to me.

Module 2- Diplomancer
The Diplomancer tracks the relations between all existing organizations in the world and also how strong they individually are.  Resources, arms, and morale.
This applies to nationstates, organizations within nation states, churches, and tribes.

Module 3- Partybuddy
This will be totally focused on the party themselves.  What they know, their current quests, quests they can take, etc.  It will likely link to their own
units in the Diplomancer.  The at a glace should show me everything the party has, whatever favors they are owed, and just what resources they can draw on.
